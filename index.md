# Welcome to My Website!


Hello! My name is Thomas Herrera. I'm a junior here at Boise State. I decided to go into this career because I thought that computers were always amazing espcially coding and understanding all the different languages that we can use to make something look cool. I'm a full time student and a full time employee as a Correctional Officer at one of the many prisons in Kuna,Idaho.
